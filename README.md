# bs-web-animations

Bucklescript/ReasonML bindings to the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API).

## Todo

See the [`Complete Base Bindings` project board](https://github.com/Sutor-Design/bs-web-animations/projects/1). Completion of this will give a complete (if possibly awful, API-wise) usable library. Look at refactoring once everything gets into the "Done" column.
